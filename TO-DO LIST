ðŸš€ Python Internship - Task 1 Completed! âœ…
I'm excited to share that I have successfully completed Task 1 - To-Do List as a part of my Python programming internship at CodSoft.

ðŸ“‹ This project involved creating a command-line-based To-Do List application using Python, helping users manage, update, and track their daily tasks efficiently. It was a great experience implementing concepts like:

File handling

Conditional logic

Loops and functions

User interaction via terminal


ðŸ’¡ This project enhanced my understanding of how to build real-world utility applications using Python.
